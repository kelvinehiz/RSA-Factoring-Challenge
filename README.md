# RSA Factor Challenge

This is an RSA factorization challenge implemented in C. The challenge involves factoring a large semiprime number into its two prime factors.



## Introduction

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is a widely used public-key cryptosystem. The RSA factor challenge aims to test your ability to factorize a large semiprime number, which is the product of two large prime numbers.

## Prerequisites

To run this challenge, you need:

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- C Standard Library
